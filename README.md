Assignment: Full Stack Web Development Project (MERN Stack) with TypeScript, Shell Script, Backend Documentation, and Frontend Storybook

Duration: 1 week

Instructions: Welcome to our Full Stack Web Development assignment! In this task, you will be working on building a complete web application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) with TypeScript. Additionally, you will be required to write a shell script to run both the client and server applications. The backend should have comprehensive documentation, and the frontend should have Storybook integration.

Task: You are required to create a web application that allows users to manage their to-do list. The application should provide a user-friendly interface to add, update, and delete tasks. Additionally, the application should have user authentication functionality to ensure that each user can access their own to-do list securely.

Requirements:

Frontend:
1. Build the frontend using React.js with TypeScript for the user interface.
2. Implement user authentication and registration pages to allow users to sign up and log in.
3. Create pages to display the user's to-do list, allowing them to add, update, and delete tasks.
4. Integrate Storybook into the frontend to document and showcase UI components.

Backend:
1. Build the backend using Node.js and Express.js with TypeScript to handle API requests and responses.
2. Use MongoDB as the database to store user information and their respective to-do lists.
3. Implement user authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure secure access to user-specific data.
4. Provide comprehensive documentation for the backend API.

Shell Script:
1. Write a shell script that sets up and runs both the client and server applications with a single command.

Full Stack Integration:
1. Integrate the frontend and backend to work together seamlessly for a complete web application.
2. Implement data exchange between the frontend and backend using API calls.
